# Ford-Car-Prediction
The presented data science project aims to predict car prices for Ford vehicles using machine learning techniques. To achieve this, a dataset provided by Kaggle will be used, specifically the "Ford Car Price Prediction" dataset.

In the current context, the second-hand car market is highly dynamic, and prices can vary significantly based on different factors such as the car's model, manufacturing year, mileage, overall condition, and other relevant attributes... The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable price prediction model for Ford cars, which will provide a valuable tool for both buyers and sellers.
